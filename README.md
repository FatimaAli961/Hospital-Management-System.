Hospital Management System Project
Appointment Management System (HAMS) is designed to digitize and simplify the appointment process in hospitals and clinics. It allows patients to book or cancel appointments easily, while giving doctors and administrators a clear view of daily schedules. The system reduces paperwork, minimizes human error, and improves communication between hospital staff and patients. Key features:

Patient Management (add, edit, view, delete patient profiles)
Doctor Management (manage doctor details and availability)
Appointment Management (book, cancel, reschedule appointments)
Reports & Statistics (daily/weekly summaries of visits and schedules)
